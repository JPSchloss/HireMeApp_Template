### How To Build Your Own

1. Load your resume into the file where this is kept as a PDF file. 

2. Update the Markdown files to reflect how you want to design the pages. 
    - intro.md is for your indtroduction page. 
    - resume.md is for your resume presented as markdown. 
    - sample_projects.md if where you can add descriptions of your projects as markdown files. 

3. Set up your API key. 
    - If in development this should be a .env file, but when deploying you can use Streamlit's Secret Manager. 

4. Test out and at this point it should be working. 

5. Customize and update how you see fit!
